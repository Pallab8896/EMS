# EMS
Expense Management System using MEAN Stack

# Getting Started

Super simple Angular app with 1 module and 2 routes. This app has two sections - Home and Settings. User can define a budget in settings in addition to defining different categories in which expenses can be made. Once this step is done the user can add expenses in any of the categories in the home page.
